# Purpose of the project:

The purpose of this project is to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Filters based on date, city, state, country and shape are developed to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. The webpage is developed and deployed in GitHub.

# Conclusion.
The page is nicely and beautifully developed using the Bootstrap jumbotron CSS file and link.  The filters able to filter based on request from user. However, once you enter input, you have to refresh the page to clear the entered input. A clear button could make it easier. Further, the cities are not very well known and hence user can be easily made mistake or has to go through all the data.
